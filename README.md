# Bagel-Company

I have been working on my personal website for a couple months and I wanted to switch things up.
I wanted to create a website for fun by thinking of a random prompt and then trying to create a website for it.
First it was supermarket, then it was restaurant...
But finally I decided on BAGEL STORE.

I drafted up the logos and the pages and started coding.
